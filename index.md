## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the department of artificial intelligence in [Korea University](https://korea.edu/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do), supervised by [Prof. Sangpil Kim](https://kuaicv.com/professor/). My research focuses on deep learning based computer vision for autonomous driving and robot navigation. Specifically, processing visual perceptions for motion and trajectory prediction is my primary interest. Ultimately, my goal is to develop safe autonomous driving systems or robots that can interact harmoniously with humans and koalas!üöôüßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüê®ü§ñ
